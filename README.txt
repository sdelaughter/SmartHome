This is a distributed system simulating a home "internet-of-things" network composed of a gateway, backend database, and user terminal, along with several sensors and smart devices.

I initially created it as a project for my graduate course on Distributed Operating Systems at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Three distinct versions are currently included, each from a different assigment.  Each version has its own unique set of features.  In general, newer versions are more reliable and feature-rich than older ones, but some event-ordering features were removed between v0.2 and v0.3.  The original assignments are also included with each version as PDFs.
